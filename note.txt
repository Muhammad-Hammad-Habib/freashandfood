You must send the following object to get filtered data:

Method : GET
{
  "id": "4584",              // CustomerId of the logged-in user
  "startDate": "2000-11-12", // Start date must be in the format "YYYY-MM-DD"
  "endDate": "2029-11-27"    // End date must be in the format "YYYY-MM-DD"
}
Both start date and end date must be provided. If either is missing, the result will be empty.
If the date format is incorrect, the query may still run but the result will not be valid.
